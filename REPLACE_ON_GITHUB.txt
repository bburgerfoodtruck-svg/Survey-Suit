SURVEY SUITE – v9.0 (Ventilation + HHSRS)

✅ Added a home screen selector:
   - Ventilation / Damp / Mould
   - HHSRS Calculator

✅ Added Light/Dark mode toggle (saved on device).
✅ HHSRS module included (29 hazards) with a simple scoring model and PDF export.
   IMPORTANT: If you already have your exact HHSRS logic from the other session,
   paste it into src/HhsrsApp.jsx by replacing computeBand() and/or the UI fields.

Upload to GitHub (replace everything):
1) Unzip
2) Upload EVERYTHING inside the folder to the ROOT of your repo (NOT the folder itself)
3) Commit → Vercel redeploys automatically

Local test:
npm install
npm run dev


v1.1 note:
- HHSRS module now uses the HHSRS score formula + A–J banding.
- To use your exact workbook default profiles, replace src/hhsrs/hazardStats.js with the full object from your HTML (HAZARD_STATS).


READY-TO-GO DATASET OPTION:
- In HHSRS, click “Import dataset” and upload your old HHSRS HTML file.
- The app will automatically extract HAZARD_STATS and save it locally on that device.
- Use “Reset dataset” to revert.
